# CITE-ODE: Continuous-Time Evidential Neural ODEs for Uncertainty-Aware ICU Risk Prediction

Official PyTorch implementation of **CITE-ODE**, a continuous-time evidential learning framework for uncertainty-aware ICU risk prediction from irregularly sampled clinical telemetry.

Designed for submission to the **IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2026) Applied Track**.

---

# 📌 Framework Overview

ICU telemetry data is sparse, irregularly sampled, and frequently interrupted by long contiguous gaps caused by monitor disconnects, workflow changes, and missing charting. Traditional sequence models often rely on imputation strategies that distort temporal structure and provide no principled estimate of epistemic uncertainty.

**CITE-ODE** addresses these limitations through three integrated components:

## 1. Continuous-Time Trajectory Modeling

A Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) backbone models physiological trajectories continuously in time, directly handling irregular sampling without imputation.

## 2. Evidential Representation Learning

Latent trajectories are projected through a Normal-Inverse-Gamma (NIG) evidential head that estimates predictive uncertainty in a single forward pass.

Epistemic uncertainty is computed as:

\[
u = \frac{\beta}{\alpha - 1}
\]

## 3. Selective Prediction Framework

Predictions are ranked using epistemic uncertainty and selectively filtered at predefined coverage levels (100%, 90%, 80%, 70%).

A stratified random control preserving class prevalence isolates the effect of uncertainty ranking from prevalence-induced calibration changes.

# 📥 Dataset & Cohort Information

To support peer-review reproducibility without requiring live database access, the evaluation cohort is stored as an external artifact rather than in Git history.

## Dataset Details

- **Source Dataset:** MIMIC-IV Clinical Database
- **Cohort Size:** 10,000 ICU stays
- **Observation Window:** 24 hours
- **Signals:** 8 vital signs
- **Target:** Binary in-hospital mortality

Download the cohort into the repository with:

```bash
pip install gdown
python scripts/fetch_cohort.py
```

The script writes the file to:

```text
data/mimic_cemr_cohort.csv
```

Google Drive source folder:

https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1oupz5CcQIMn-16I8KFWeqlpirY0vBCxg

Quick download instructions (two options):

1) Use the included Python helper (recommended):

```bash
pip install gdown
python scripts/fetch_cohort.py
```

2) Directly download the Drive folder with `gdown` (requires `gdown` supporting folder downloads):

```bash
# download the entire folder into `data/`
gdown --folder "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oupz5CcQIMn-16I8KFWeqlpirY0vBCxg" -O data/
```

After downloading, verify the file exists:

```bash
ls -lh data/mimic_cemr_cohort.csv
```

# 🔍 Key Findings

- Uncertainty-guided filtering reduces conditional calibration error by more than 50% at 80% coverage.
- Stratified random controls preserving prevalence do not exhibit equivalent calibration improvements.
- Learned epistemic uncertainty is therefore informative for calibration-aware filtering.
- CITE-ODE intentionally trades some discriminative performance (AUROC) for improved uncertainty reliability under structured missingness.
- Subgroup variability correlates primarily with sample size, with no persistent directional bias observed.
